# VBA_Challenge_Stock_Analysis

## OverView of the Project

### Refractor challenge to loop through stock market data set.
We delivered Steve a workbook where at the click of a button he can analyze an entire dataset to compare stocks between two years, 2017 and 2018. We are now wondering if we can expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Would this script work for thousands of stocks? And if it does work would it take a long time to execute?

### Result:

use images and examples of code to compare stock performance between 2017 and 2018


#### Execution times of original script
